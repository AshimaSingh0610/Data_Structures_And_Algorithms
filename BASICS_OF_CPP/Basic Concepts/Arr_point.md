# Basic Conncepts

### Input and Output *(`cin,cout`)*

- **`cin`**: This stands for "character input" and is used to take input from the user. It's part of the C++ Standard Library and is typically used to get data from the keyboard. When you use `cin`, you're telling the program to wait for the user to type something and then store that input into a variable.

- **`cout`**: This stands for "character output" and is used to display output to the user. It sends data to the screen. When you use `cout`, you're instructing the program to show information to the user.

**How It Works:**

- When you use `std::cout << "Some text"`, it prints `"Some text"` on the screen.
- When you use `std::cin >> variable`, it waits for the user to input data and then stores it in `variable`.

**Example Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream> // Includes the necessary library for input and output

int main() {
    int age; // Declare a variable to store the user's age

    std::cout << "Enter your age: "; // Prompt the user to enter their age
    std::cin >> age; // Read the age from the keyboard and store it in the variable

    std::cout << "You are " << age << " years old." << std::endl; // Display the age
    return 0;
}
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Enter your age: 18
You are 18 years old.
```

**Explanation:**

1. The program asks the user to enter their age.
2. The user types `18` and presses Enter.
3. The program reads the input and then displays "You are 18 years old."

### Arrays and Strings

- **Arrays**: An array is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. You can think of it as a list where each item (element) can be accessed using an index. The index starts at 0. Arrays are useful for storing multiple values and are fundamental in programming.

- **Strings**: A string is a sequence of characters, such as text. In C++, strings can be managed using arrays of characters (C-style strings) or the `std::string` class from the Standard Library. `std::string` provides more functionality and is generally preferred for handling text.

**Types of Arrays:**

1. **Single-Dimensional Array**: A basic list of elements. For example, `int numbers[5]` declares an array of five integers.

2. **Multi-Dimensional Array**: An array of arrays. For example, `int matrix[2][3]` creates a 2x3 matrix.`[row][colums]`

3. **Dynamic Array**: An array whose size can be determined at runtime. Managed using pointers and dynamic memory allocation (e.g., `new` keyword).

**Types of Strings:**

1. **C-Style String**: An array of characters terminated by a null character (`'\0'`). Example: `char name[] = "John";`.

2. **`std::string`**: A class from the C++ Standard Library that simplifies string handling, offering methods for manipulation and querying.

**How It Works:**

- **Arrays**: Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations and accessed using an index. For example, `numbers[0]` accesses the first element.

- **Strings**: 
  - **C-Style Strings**: Use functions like `strlen` and `strcpy` from `<cstring>`.
  - **`std::string`**: Use member functions like `.length()`, `.substr()`, and operators like `+` for concatenation.

**Examples:**

1. **Single-Dimensional Array Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       int numbers[3] = {10, 20, 30}; // An array of integers

       // Print the first element of the array
       cout << "First number: " << numbers[0] << endl;

       // Print all elements of the array
       cout << "All numbers: ";
       for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
           cout << numbers[i] << " ";
       }
       cout << endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   First number: 10
   All numbers: 10 20 30
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   1. The program initializes an array `numbers` with three integers.
   2. It prints the first element and all elements of the array using a loop.

2. **Multi-Dimensional Array Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       int matrix[2][3] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} }; // A 2x3 matrix

       // Print the matrix
       cout << "Matrix:" << endl;
       for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
           for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
               cout << matrix[i][j] << " ";
           }
           cout << endl;
       }

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Matrix:
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   1. The program initializes a 2x3 matrix.
   2. It prints each element in matrix format using nested loops.

3. **C-Style String Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <cstring> // For strlen function
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       char name[] = "John"; // A C-style string

       cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
       cout << "Length: " << strlen(name) << endl; // Length of the string

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Name: John
   Length: 4
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   1. The program initializes a C-style string.
   2. It prints the string and its length using `strlen`.

4. **`std::string` Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string> // For std::string
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       string greeting = "Hello, World!"; // A std::string

       // Print the string
       cout << "Greeting: " << greeting << endl;

       // Modify and print the string
       greeting += " Have a great day!";
       cout << "Modified Greeting: " << greeting << endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Greeting: Hello, World!
   Modified Greeting: Hello, World! Have a great day!
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   1. The program initializes a `std::string`.
   2. It prints the string and then appends additional text using the `+=` operator.

### Pointers and References


- **Pointers**: A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Rather than holding the actual value, a pointer holds the location where the value is stored. Pointers are essential for dynamic memory management and for efficiently passing large amounts of data to functions.

- **References**: A reference is an alias or another name for an existing variable. Once a reference is initialized to a variable, it cannot be changed to refer to another variable. References are often used to modify a variable in a function without making a copy of it.

**Types of Pointers:**

1. **Null Pointer**: A pointer that does not point to any memory location. It is initialized to `nullptr` (in C++11 and later) or `NULL` (in older code).

2. **Pointer to Pointer**: A pointer that holds the address of another pointer. Useful for dynamic multi-dimensional arrays or complex data structures.

3. **Const Pointer**: A pointer that cannot change the address it points to, but the data at that address can be modified.

4. **Pointer to Constant**: A pointer that can point to different addresses, but the data at those addresses cannot be modified through the pointer.

5. **Void Pointer**: A generic pointer that can hold the address of any data type. It must be cast to another pointer type before dereferencing.

**Types of References:**

1. **Lvalue Reference**: The most common type of reference, which is used to refer to a modifiable variable.

2. **Rvalue Reference**: Introduced in C++11, used to refer to temporary objects that can be moved (e.g., for optimization in move semantics).

**How It Works:**

- **Pointers**: Provide direct access to memory and can be used to dynamically allocate memory, access array elements, and implement data structures like linked lists.

- **References**: Provide a convenient way to pass variables to functions without copying, and ensure that the function operates directly on the original variable.

**Examples:**

1. **Basic Pointer Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   int main() {
       int number = 42;        // A variable to hold an integer
       int *ptr = &number;     // A pointer to the variable

       std::cout << "Number: " << number << std::endl;
       std::cout << "Pointer points to: " << *ptr << std::endl; // Dereferencing pointer

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Number: 42
   Pointer points to: 42
   ```

   **Explanation:** The pointer `ptr` holds the address of the variable `number`. When dereferencing the pointer using `*ptr`, it shows the value of `number`.

2. **Pointer to Pointer Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   int main() {
       int number = 42;
       int *ptr = &number;      // Pointer to int
       int **ptr_to_ptr = &ptr; // Pointer to pointer

       std::cout << "Number: " << number << std::endl;
       std::cout << "Pointer points to: " << *ptr << std::endl;
       std::cout << "Pointer to pointer points to: " << **ptr_to_ptr << std::endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Number: 42
   Pointer points to: 42
   Pointer to pointer points to: 42
   ```

   **Explanation:** The `ptr_to_ptr` holds the address of `ptr`, which in turn holds the address of `number`. Dereferencing twice with `**ptr_to_ptr` retrieves the value of `number`.

3. **Const Pointer Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   int main() {
       int number = 42;
       int *const ptr = &number; // Const pointer to int

       std::cout << "Number: " << number << std::endl;
       std::cout << "Pointer points to: " << *ptr << std::endl;

       // ptr = nullptr; // Error: cannot change the address stored in ptr
       *ptr = 100;       // Allowed: can change the value at the address

       std::cout << "Modified Number: " << number << std::endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Number: 42
   Pointer points to: 42
   Modified Number: 100
   ```

   **Explanation:** The pointer `ptr` cannot point to a different address once initialized, but the value of `number` it points to can be modified.

4. **Pointer to Constant Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   int main() {
       int number = 42;
       const int *ptr = &number; // Pointer to const int

       std::cout << "Number: " << number << std::endl;
       std::cout << "Pointer points to: " << *ptr << std::endl;

       // *ptr = 100; // Error: cannot modify the value pointed to by ptr
       number = 100; // Allowed: can modify the value of number directly

       std::cout << "Modified Number: " << number << std::endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Number: 42
   Pointer points to: 42
   Modified Number: 100
   ```

   **Explanation:** The pointer `ptr` cannot be used to modify the value of `number`, but the value of `number` can be changed directly.

5. **Void Pointer Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   int main() {
       int number = 42;
       void *ptr = &number; // Void pointer

       std::cout << "Number: " << *(static_cast<int*>(ptr)) << std::endl; // Casting void pointer to int*

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Number: 42
   ```

   **Explanation:** `ptr` is a void pointer, so it cannot be dereferenced directly. It must be cast to the appropriate pointer type before dereferencing.

6. **Basic Reference Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   int main() {
       int number = 42;
       int &ref = number; // Reference to the variable

       std::cout << "Number: " << number << std::endl;
       std::cout << "Reference: " << ref << std::endl;

       ref = 100; // Modify the variable through the reference

       std::cout << "Modified Number: " << number << std::endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Number: 42
   Reference: 42
   Modified Number: 100
   ```

   **Explanation:** The reference `ref` is an alias for `number`. Changes to `ref` affect `number` directly.

7. **Rvalue Reference Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   void processValue(int &&val) { // Rvalue reference
       std::cout << "Processing value: " << val << std::endl;
   }

   int main() {
       processValue(42); // Passing an rvalue (temporary value)
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Processing value: 42
   ```

   **Explanation:** The function `processValue` takes an rvalue reference, which is used to handle temporary values or move semantics in modern C++.

### Structs and Enums

**Theory:**

- **Structs**: A `struct` (short for structure) is a user-defined data type that allows you to group different types of variables together under a single name. Each variable in a struct is called a member. Structs are useful for modeling real-world entities by grouping related data.

- **Enums**: An `enum` (short for enumeration) is a user-defined type that consists of a set of named values. Enums make code more readable by using meaningful names instead of numeric constants. They are often used to represent a fixed set of related constants.

**Types of Structs:**

1. **Simple Struct**: Contains basic data types.
2. **Nested Struct**: Contains other structs as members.
3. **Struct with Methods**: Contains functions along with data members.

**Types of Enums:**

1. **Unscoped Enum**: The traditional C++ enum where the names are in the scope of the enclosing scope.
2. **Scoped Enum**: Introduced in C++11, where the names are scoped within the enum type, providing better type safety.

**How It Works:**

- **Structs**: Allow grouping related data. For example, a `Student` struct can group a student's name and age.

- **Enums**: Provide a way to define variables that can only take a limited set of predefined values, improving code readability and reducing errors.

**Examples:**

1. **Simple Struct Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>

   struct Student { // Struct to hold student information
       std::string name;
       int age;
   };

   int main() {
       Student student1 = {"Alice", 20}; // Create an instance of Student

       // Print student information
       std::cout << "Student's name: " << student1.name << std::endl;
       std::cout << "Student's age: " << student1.age << std::endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Student's name: Alice
   Student's age: 20
   ```

   **Explanation:** The program defines a `Student` struct with `name` and `age` as members. It creates a `Student` instance and prints the student's details.

2. **Nested Struct Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>

   struct Address { // Nested struct to hold address information
       std::string street;
       std::string city;
   };

   struct Person { // Main struct to hold person information
       std::string name;
       int age;
       Address address; // Nested struct as a member
   };

   int main() {
       Person person1 = {"Bob", 25, {"123 Elm St", "Springfield"}}; // Create an instance of Person

       // Print person information
       std::cout << "Name: " << person1.name << std::endl;
       std::cout << "Age: " << person1.age << std::endl;
       std::cout << "Street: " << person1.address.street << std::endl;
       std::cout << "City: " << person1.address.city << std::endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Name: Bob
   Age: 25
   Street: 123 Elm St
   City: Springfield
   ```

   **Explanation:** The program defines a nested `Address` struct inside the `Person` struct. It prints all the details of a `Person`, including nested address information.

3. **Struct with Methods Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <string>

   struct Rectangle { // Struct with methods
       int width;
       int height;

       // Method to calculate area
       int area() {
           return width * height;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Rectangle rect = {10, 5}; // Create an instance of Rectangle

       // Print the area of the rectangle
       std::cout << "Area of the rectangle: " << rect.area() << std::endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Area of the rectangle: 50
   ```

   **Explanation:** The `Rectangle` struct contains a method `area()` that calculates the area based on the `width` and `height`. It prints the calculated area.

4. **Unscoped Enum Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   enum Day { MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY }; // Enum for days of the week

   int main() {
       Day today = WEDNESDAY; // Set the current day

       // Print the day number
       std::cout << "Today is day number: " << today << std::endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Today is day number: 2
   ```

   **Explanation:** The enum `Day` defines constants for days of the week. `WEDNESDAY` is assigned the value `2` by default, which is printed.

5. **Scoped Enum Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   enum class Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE }; // Scoped enum for colors

   int main() {
       Color favoriteColor = Color::GREEN; // Set the favorite color

       // Print the color value
       std::cout << "Favorite color number: " << static_cast<int>(favoriteColor) << std::endl;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Favorite color number: 1
   ```

   **Explanation:** The scoped enum `Color` prevents name collisions and provides type safety. `Color::GREEN` has a value of `1` and is printed after casting to `int`.

### Basic File Handling


- **File Streams**: C++ provides file streams for reading from and writing to files. These streams are part of the `<fstream>` library.
  - `std::ofstream`: Used for writing data to files (output file stream).
  - `std::ifstream`: Used for reading data from files (input file stream).

- **Opening and Closing Files**: 
  - To perform file operations, you first need to open a file using file streams. 
  - After completing the operations, it's essential to close the file to save changes and release system resources.

**How It Works:**

1. **Writing to a File**:
   - Create an `std::ofstream` object and open the file by specifying its name.
   - Use the stream's `<<` operator to write data to the file.
   - Close the file using the `close()` method.

2. **Reading from a File**:
   - Create an `std::ifstream` object and open the file by specifying its name.
   - Use the stream's `>>` operator or `getline()` function to read data from the file.
   - Close the file using the `close()` method.

**Types of File Operations:**

1. **Writing to a File**: 
   - Writing plain text or formatted data to a file.
   - Example: Creating a file and writing some text.

2. **Reading from a File**: 
   - Reading plain text or formatted data from a file.
   - Example: Reading and displaying content from a file.

**Examples:**

1. **Writing to a File Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <fstream> // For file operations

   int main() {
       // Writing to a file
       std::ofstream outFile("data.txt"); // Open file for writing

       if (outFile.is_open()) {
           outFile << "Hello, file!" << std::endl; // Write to the file
           outFile.close(); // Close the file
           std::cout << "Data written to file successfully." << std::endl;
       } else {
           std::cerr << "Unable to open file for writing." << std::endl;
       }

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Data written to file successfully.
   ```

   **Explanation:** 
   - The program creates a file named `data.txt` and writes the text "Hello, file!" to it.
   - After writing, it closes the file and prints a confirmation message.

2. **Reading from a File Example:**

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   #include <fstream> // For file operations
   #include <string>  // For std::string

   int main() {
       // Reading from a file
       std::ifstream inFile("data.txt"); // Open file for reading
       std::string line;

       if (inFile.is_open()) {
           while (getline(inFile, line)) { // Read file line by line
               std::cout << line << std::endl; // Display each line
           }
           inFile.close(); // Close the file
       } else {
           std::cerr << "Unable to open file for reading." << std::endl;
       }

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Hello, file!
   ```

   **Explanation:** 
   - The program opens the file `data.txt` for reading.
   - It reads each line from the file and prints it to the screen.
   - After reading, it closes the file.
